## Instructions for future parsing ##

1. open doubleMergeNew.py
2. populate with odds file (generated via accumulate.py)
3. populate with game data file (grabbed from basketball reference)
4. run

There is a lot of extra mess in here, because I was generating a big data set (cleaned_data.csv) with all
game results and odds, but I did not have entire data of odds. This lead to me dealing with a bunch of data
in different formats, and trying to stich them all together. I am leaving them in here, in case of an emergency,
but they should not be needed for future use.
